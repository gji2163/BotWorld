# Welcome to Bot World: Rise of the Bots! 🌍🤖

In the year 2050, a catastrophic event occurred when Botania, a planet smaller than the Moon, veered off its orbit and collided with Earth. The impact resulted in a devastating doomsday scenario, wiping out 99.1% of humanity. The few remaining individuals merged with an extraterrestrial parasite known as "bots," granting them incredible powers. Approximately 90% of the survivors underwent this mutation, acquiring superhuman abilities.
